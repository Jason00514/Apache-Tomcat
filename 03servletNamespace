Upgrading Considerations:
When upgrading between major versions, particularly from Tomcat 9 to Tomcat 10, 
the namespace change from javax to jakarta is a critical factor. 

This requires significant modifications in the application's source code and dependencies. 
Additionally, reviewing and updating the configuration files to align with the new version's specifications is necessary.

------------------tomcat 9 javax.servlet start----------------
Example of a Servlet Migration:
From Tomcat 9 (Servlet 4.0):
java
コードをコピーする
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import java.io.IOException;

@WebServlet("/example")
public class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.getWriter().write("Hello, World!");
    }
}
------------------tomcat 9  javax.servlet end----------------

------------------tomcat 10  jakarta.servlet start----------------
To Tomcat 10 (Servlet 5.0):
java
コードをコピーする
import jakarta.servlet.*;
import jakarta.servlet.http.*;
import java.io.IOException;

@WebServlet("/example")
public class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.getWriter().write("Hello, World!");
    }
}
------------------tomcat 10 jakarta.servlet end---------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tomcat has undergone various significant upgrades over its versions. 
Some of the most notable upgrades involve performance improvements, new features, and compliance with updated specifications. 
Below are some key upgrades across different major versions of Tomcat:

Tomcat 8.0 to 8.5:
HTTP/2 Support: Tomcat 8.5 introduced support for HTTP/2, enhancing performance and resource utilization for web applications.
Improved Memory Management: Enhancements in memory management and resource handling, providing better performance and stability.
Simplified Configuration: Reduced the complexity of the default configuration for easier setup and maintenance.

Tomcat 8.5 to 9.0:
Servlet 4.0 Specification: Full implementation of the Servlet 4.0 specification, including HTTP/2 support.
JSP 2.3 and EL 3.0: Support for the latest JSP and Expression Language versions, offering more features and better integration.
OpenID Connect Authentication: Introduction of an OpenID Connect authentication module for more flexible security configurations.
Resource Management Improvements: Enhancements in how Tomcat manages resources like threads, connections, and memory.

Tomcat 9.0 to 10.0:
Jakarta EE 9: The most significant change is the transition from the Java EE namespace (javax.) to the Jakarta EE namespace (jakarta.). 
This affects all APIs and requires application code changes.
Servlet 5.0 Specification: Implementation of the Servlet 5.0 specification, aligned with Jakarta EE 9.
Improved HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support: Continued improvements in HTTP/2 support and experimental support for HTTP/3.
TLS Configuration: Enhanced TLS (Transport Layer Security) configuration options for better security and performance.
WebSocket 2.0: Support for the latest WebSocket API, allowing for more efficient real-time communication.


Summary:
The upgrades in Tomcat across versions typically involve improved support for the latest Java EE/Jakarta EE specifications, better performance, 
enhanced security features, and additional capabilities like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support. 
When planning an upgrade, careful consideration of the changes in API and configuration requirements is essential to ensure a smooth transition.
